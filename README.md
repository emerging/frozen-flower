ATENTION!!! THIS IS OLD CODE FROM 2007 AND I AM STILL REVEWING IT!!! THERE ARE KNOWN BUGS AND POSSIBLE SECURITY ISSUES!!!

Frozen Flower was a Photo Aggregator Website and Community I created in 2007. It compiled posts from several photo blogs and showed them all together. It had a blog and some community tools.

The aggregation script is python, and I used apoidea to create the PHP backoffice and the mySQL database, both for the aggregation management, and for the creation of the blog.
