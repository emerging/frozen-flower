# Frozen flower

This is a project from 2007 that has not been updated since. It's here just for history keeping.

Frozen Flower was a Photo Aggregator Website and Community I created in 2007. It compiled posts from several photo blogs and showed them all together. It had a blog and some community tools.

The aggregation script is python, and I used the apoidea project to create the PHP backoffice and the mySQL database, both for the aggregation management, and for the creation of the blog.
